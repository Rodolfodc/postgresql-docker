## Running PostgreSQL and Flyway in Docker

To run PostgreSQL in Docker and apply schema using flyway, you have to run:
```
./run_in_docker.sh
```

Press Ctrl+C when you no longer need db to run. To remove instance from your local machine run:
```
./destroy_docker_instance.sh
```

More details about this repo will be on my blog soon.
